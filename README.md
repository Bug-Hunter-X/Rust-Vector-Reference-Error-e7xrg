This repository contains a simple Rust program that demonstrates a common error related to vector references.  The program pushes elements into a vector, creates a reference to an element, and then attempts to modify the vector. This causes a runtime panic because the reference becomes invalid when the vector's capacity changes. The solution demonstrates how to avoid this error by using techniques that ensure reference validity.
